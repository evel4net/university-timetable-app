# University Timetable App
A personal Android app for viewing my university timetable. Built using **C#** and the **.NET MAUI** framework.

## Features
- **Local storage**: timetable data is stored locally on the device
- **Manual data reload**: user can manually refresh the timetable via pressing a button, which loads the data from a web server hosting a *timetable.html* page and saves the data locally
- **Configuration**: set the web server path in the *UBB/App.xaml.cs* file (*Note: the actual server path is omitted for privacy*)
- **Example HTML data**: an example of *timetable.html* is available in the *AppServer* folder
